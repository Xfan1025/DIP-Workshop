# Python Environment (local, CPU-only) Setup Guide

## Download and install Anaconda
Choose Python 3.x version: https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos

* for Windows, type: `$ conda activate DIP`
* for mac/linux, type: `$ source activate DIP`

### 2. Install packages
Type command:
`$ conda install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib tensorflow keras jupyterlab ipykernel`

`$ pip install pillow opencv-python`

### 3. Validate your installation
Type command:
`$ jupyter lab` to start the interactive notebook for your experiments. By default, a service will be running at http://localhost:8888/. You can access it using any browser.

Then create a notebook, run the following code:

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
```

You should see no error.
